16:37 <migueldeicaza> A large chunk was completed last week 
16:38 <migueldeicaza> @alistair well Mono has its implementation, xbuild, and it lacks a lot of things
16:38 <migueldeicaza> We had started to contribute to the open sourced msbuild, in the xplat branch, and were getting good traction
16:39 <migueldeicaza> We were systematically fixing every test suite and fixing the code to make it work on Unix 
16:39 <migueldeicaza> The effort was to bring msbuild functionality as-is to Mono
16:40 <migueldeicaza> But the msbuild team sort of took over that branch, and started chopping things left and right to make it work with CoreCLR
16:40 <migueldeicaza> So we are left in the very uncomfortable position of the cross platform msbuild being now an unspecified subset of msbuild with the sole goal of supporting CoreCLR
